## Nebula demo

This is a very basic example project for the [Nebula game engine](https://github.com/gscept/nebula/)

To get started, clone this repository into a seperate folder (it will create folders for dependencies in the same folder) and run the [setup.bat](setup.bat), which should configure and compile dependencies and open visual studio at the end for you. Refer to the documentation on the main repository for more information!
